# Introduction

## Preparation for trainers

Here are some general tips provided by CiviCRM trainers:

- See if any learners want to do a presentation on how they are using CiviCRM. Having one of these on each day is great.
- Before each session, open up tabs which will be useful.
- Do not try and explain absolutely everything or talk too much about edge cases - there is more than can be covered in the length of an average training course.
- Try not to interrupt exercises, better to share additional insights at the end.
- Check how learners have answered the questions on an individual basis (like a teacher would). You'll likely find a few mistakes and it will give you a good idea about how individual people are getting on. You can start doing this towards the end of the exercise period.

## Course Introduction

- Icebreaker examples:
    1. Get attendees to interview each other in pairs. Tell them they'll report back to the group on their partner. They should report back on their interviewee's:
        - Name.
        - Organisation.
        - What they do there.
        - How they are using CiviCRM.
        - What they want out of the training.
    2. Get everyone to introduce themselves:
        - Name
        - Organisation
        - One thing they are finding challenging
        - One thing they are excited about
- Possible structure of training:
    - 5 sessions each day - each is 1 hour long.
    - 1 hour of extra time at the end of the day.
    - Sessions format is generally:
        - presentations and discussion, followed by
        - exercises, followed by recap of the session
        - start with the basics, gets more advanced as we go on.
- Exercises:
    - You don't need to include all of them - you can save some for afterwards.
    - Please feedback on our exercises as we go. If you think of something, make a note and feed it back to us.
- Questions
    - Feel free to ask questions as we go
    - Please also respect everyone's time - we are a diverse group so please don't ask a long series of questions on your very specific use case.
- Usernames and passwords:
    - Wi-Fi connection information.
    - Training CiviCRM site username and password.
- Venue specific information:
    - Emergency exits.
    - Toilet locations.

At the end of each day you may wish to "round up", we've provided some example/suggested steps below:

- Tell people what they just learned - (go back through the day)
- Tell people to think about their choice of session for day 2
- Choice of session
- Reminder about feedback on exercises. If you think of something, make a note and feed it back to us.
- **At the end of the course:** Thanks for coming
- **At the end of the course:** Hope it was useful

## Subsequent Day Introductions

If you're running a multi-day training course you may wish to do a small recap at the beginning of the 2nd/3rd/Nth days, we've provided an example format below:

- Ask people to tell us about something they learnt yesterday
- Recap the day for them
- Introduce this day
- Decide on the topic for the afternoon
- Reminder about feedback on exercises. If you think of something, make a note and feed it back to us.
